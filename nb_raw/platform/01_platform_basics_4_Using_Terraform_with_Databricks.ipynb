    "Terraform is a software tool that allows you to define infrastructure as code. Terraform integrates with hundreds of upstream APIs including Databricks. Most of the resources exposed by Databricks APIs can be managed with Terraform.\n",

    "* A free, open source self-managed tool available in binary form that can be run in a variety of operating systems\n",
    "* A managed SaaS platform known as **Terraform Cloud** that offers free and paid tiers\n",
    "\n",

Users typically install it in their own environment, where they can invoke it manually or integrate it with upstream CI/CD processes. In this lab, we will take advantage of the execution environment provided by the attached all-purpose cluster for the purpose of demonstrating installation and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When managing Terraform on your own, there's a couple important considerations to keep in mind. The details of these fall outside the scope of this lab, but we mention them here so that you will be aware of them if you choose to go down this route.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Configuration files:** Terraform configurations are defined by a collection of text files written in Terraform language. Since this is infrastructure as code, these files should be treated like any other code. It's definitely a good idea to manage them using revision control.\n",
    "* **Authentication:** because Terraform uses Databricks APIs, it needs authentication credentials. If you happen to be using the Databricks CLI in the same environment, Terraform can use its authentication setup. Otherwise, environment variables are generally considered the safest option. As a final resort, credentials can be embedded in the configuration files themselves, but be careful with this since it's easy to inadvertently distribute to others directly or through revision control.\n",
    "* **State management:** Terraform tracks and records the current state of the system using a *backend*, and this part is crucial for Terraform to function correctly and reliably. The backend storage must be persistent (at least for the life of the resources it manages) and accessible by all who may be managing the configuration."

We learned how to apply these concepts to both the self-managed open source version of Terraform, as well as the Terraform Cloud managed service. As intricate as this lab may have seemed, it only touched on basic configurations and workflows. There are many more options available, too numerous to address in the context of a simple lab.
